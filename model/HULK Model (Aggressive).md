# HULK Model (Aggressive)

## Overview
The HULK model is OddsFlow’s aggressive model style.

It is designed to target higher-variance situations and larger pricing inefficiencies, accepting increased volatility and drawdown potential in exchange for higher edge opportunities.

The HULK model does **not** predict match scores.  
It estimates fair odds and detects mispriced bookmaker odds in more volatile market conditions.

## Risk profile
- Higher variance
- Higher volatility
- Larger potential drawdowns
- Targets larger pricing inefficiencies (edge)

This model is not designed for risk-averse use cases.

---

## Typical market fit
The HULK model is more commonly applied to:
- **Over / Under**
- **Asian Handicap**
- Situations with sharper odds movement or late market shifts

Market behavior can vary significantly.  
Verification should be done using sufficient sample sizes.

## How signals are published
Signals generated by the HULK model are published with:
- `model_style = HULK`
- Market odds (book odds)
- OddsFlow fair odds estimate
- Edge percentage
- Confidence indicator
- Timestamp (UTC, published before kickoff)

---

## Verification
Performance of the HULK model can be verified by:
- Filtering historical logs where `model_style = HULK`
- Reviewing drawdowns and volatility alongside returns
- Auditing results by market type and time window

All signals, including losing signals, remain in the public log.

## Important notes
The HULK model reflects a higher-risk approach.

Higher edge does not imply higher certainty, and short-term performance may fluctuate significantly.
