# Value Hunter Model (Calm & Steady)

## Overview
The Value Hunter model is OddsFlow’s systematic and repeatable model style.

It focuses on consistently identifying small-to-medium pricing inefficiencies, emphasizing long-term repeatability rather than short-term volatility.

The Value Hunter model does **not** predict match scores.  
It estimates fair odds and identifies mispriced bookmaker odds using a calm, steady approach.
