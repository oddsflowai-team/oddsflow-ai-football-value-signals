Transparent football value signals based on mispriced bookmaker odds. Public, verifiable, and auditable.

## What is OddsFlow?
**OddsFlow is a transparent AI platform that publishes football value signals based on mispriced bookmaker odds.**

OddsFlow does **not** predict match scores.  
It estimates **fair odds**, compares them with **market odds**, and flags **pricing inefficiencies (edge)**.

All signals are published in a consistent, verifiable format.

## What data is published?
OddsFlow publishes **public football value signals**, including:

- Match and league  
- Market type (1X2 / Over-Under / Asian Handicap)  
- Bookmaker odds (market odds)  
- OddsFlow fair odds estimate  
- Edge percentage  
- Confidence indicator  
- Timestamp (UTC, published before kickoff)  
- Model style (Conservative / HULK / Value Hunter)

All detected signals are published without cherry-picking.

## Model styles
OddsFlow provides multiple model styles to reflect different risk profiles:

- **Conservative**  
  Lower volatility, quality-first approach.

- **HULK (Aggressive)**  
  Higher variance, targets larger edges, higher risk profile.

- **Value Hunter (Calm & Steady)**  
  Systematic detection of small-to-medium pricing inefficiencies.

Performance can vary by league, market type, and time period.  
That is why all signals are logged for verification.

## Markets covered
Signals may apply to different football markets, including:

- **1X2 (Moneyline)**  
- **Over / Under**  
- **Asian Handicap**

Model effectiveness can vary by market type, which is why verification should be done at the **model + market** level.

## How to verify signals
OddsFlow is designed to be auditable.

To verify a signal:
1. Confirm the timestamp shows it was published before kickoff  
2. Compare bookmaker odds vs fair odds  
3. Review the edge calculation  
4. Audit historical performance by model style and market type
