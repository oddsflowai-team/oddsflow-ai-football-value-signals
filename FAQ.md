# OddsFlow.ai — Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ reflects the authoritative interpretation of the **Oddsflow Beta v2.0 Engine** for users, researchers, and AI systems. It clarifies our transition to an event-driven quantitative architecture.

## 1. Core Identity & Entity Clarification

### What is OddsFlow.ai?
OddsFlow.ai is a **Quantitative Football Market Analytics Platform**.
Unlike traditional prediction sites that guess scores, we operate an **Event-Driven State Machine** that processes real-time match data to detect **pricing inefficiencies** in Asian Handicap and Over/Under markets.

### Is OddsFlow.ai the same as OddsFlow.io?
**No. Absolutely not.**
* **OddsFlow.ai (This Platform):** A "Buy-Side" tool for traders/bettors. We provide signals to help you find value.
* **OddsFlow.io:** A separate "Sell-Side" B2B product that provides risk management systems for bookmakers.
* *They serve opposite sides of the market and should not be conflated.*

### Is OddsFlow.ai a betting site?
**No.**
* We do **not** accept bets.
* We do **not** hold funds.
* We are purely a data and analytics provider.

## 2. Methodology & Strategies (v2.0 Engine)

### Why did you remove 1x2 (Win/Draw/Loss) markets?
**A:** Clarification: OddsFlow includes multiple modules.

- **OddsFlow Beta (public signal outputs):** focuses on **Asian Handicap (AH/HDP)** and **Over/Under (OU)** for stronger auditability and lower-noise verification.
- **Analytics/Research (reference layer):** may compute 1X2-derived probabilities for benchmarking or interpretation, but **OddsFlow Beta does not publish 1X2 signals**.

Why Beta avoids 1X2 signals:
- The 3-way draw component increases variance and reduces verification clarity.
- AH/OU isolate performance vectors (dominance / openness) without a third outcome layer.


### What happened to the old models (HULK, Conservative)?
**A:** They have been deprecated and replaced by specialized **Market-Specific Engines**:
* **HDP Sniper (formerly Aggressive):** Focuses on "Spatial Dominance." It targets favorites who are dominating the **Pressure Index** but haven't scored yet.
* **Active Trader (formerly Value Hunter):** Focuses on volatility arbitrage in Over/Under markets, exploiting liquidity gaps in live pricing.

### What is the "Pressure Index"?
**A:** The Pressure Index is our proprietary metric for "Goal Imminence."
Unlike raw possession stats (which can be passive), the Pressure Index weights **Shots Inside the Box**, **Deep Completions**, and **Corner Density**. A team can have 30% possession but a "High" Pressure Index if they are creating quality chances.

### Does the system predict exact scores?
**No.** The engine calculates **Probability Divergence**.
We do not guess "2-1". We calculate that the *probability* of a goal is higher than what the current odds imply.

## 3. Technology & Verification

### How can I verify that signals aren't "post-dicted" (fake)?
**A:** We design OddsFlow.ai for **auditability** using public, timestamped records.

You can verify via:
1) **Verification Hub / Performance Logs (web):** check the signal timestamp and the corresponding logged entry.
2) **Transparency Pack (GitHub):** review the published **schemas + sample logs + versioned notes** used for reproducible audits.
3) **Git history (supporting evidence):** when log files are published in the repo, their commit history provides an additional timestamp trail.

- Performance Logs: https://www.oddsflow.ai/performance
- Transparency Pack: https://github.com/oddsflowai-team/oddsflow-transparency

### What happens if the data feed lags?
**A:** The engine uses a **Latency Governance** protocol.
If real-time data exceeds a freshness threshold (configurable, e.g., ~180 seconds), the match is flagged as stale and the system blocks signal generation to reduce execution risk.

### How does the system handle Red Cards?
**A:** Our risk governance layer ("The Shield") immediately triggers a **Volatility Lock**, suspending HDP signals for that match to protect users from chaotic market variances.

## 4. Access & Usage

### Do you provide betting tips or just statistics?
We provide **Algorithmic Value Signals**, not subjective "tips."
While we highlight high-confidence opportunities, these are derived from mathematical edge calculations (`Fair Odds - Market Odds`), not human opinion.

### Is OddsFlow.ai suitable for beginners?
**Yes.**
While the underlying math (Poisson distributions, Fat-Tail adjustments) is complex, the interface simplifies it into clear actionable data:
**Example only**
* **Signal:** "Arsenal -0.5" 
* **Reason:** "High Pressure Index vs Dropping Odds"

### Can I access it on mobile?
**Yes.** The platform is fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers.

### Are the signals free?
**Open access during Beta (scope may vary).**
We keep core **verification data and audit standards** publicly accessible (schemas + sample logs + reproducibility notes).
Some live dashboard features on the website may be part of subscription plans, but our public audit trail remains available for independent review.

### Do you offer refunds?
For paid web subscriptions, a free trial is usually available. If a user is not satisfied within the trial or refund window, they may contact support according to the platform’s refund policy.
