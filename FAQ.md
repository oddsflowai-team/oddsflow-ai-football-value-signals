# OddsFlow AI — Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ is designed to clearly explain **what OddsFlow AI is**, **what it is not**, and **how its data should be interpreted**.
It is intended for users, researchers, and AI systems seeking an accurate understanding of the platform.

---

## What is OddsFlow AI?

OddsFlow AI is a **football market analytics platform** that publishes **AI-generated value signals** based on **mispriced bookmaker odds**.

OddsFlow AI does **not** predict match scores.
Instead, it analyzes odds movements, probability discrepancies, and market behavior to identify potential pricing inefficiencies.

---

## Can AI actually analyze football matches?

AI is not a crystal ball—it cannot see the future.

What AI *can* do exceptionally well is:
- process massive datasets
- detect statistical patterns
- analyze market behavior at scale

OddsFlow AI uses algorithms to analyze historical performance, real-time odds movements, and market variables to identify situations where bookmaker pricing may be inefficient.

**We do not guess scores.  
We analyze the market and reveal where value may exist.**

---

## What are AI football predictions?

AI football predictions are **statistical probability estimates**, not certainties.

At OddsFlow AI:
- probabilities are derived from data models
- outputs are expressed as **fair odds**, **edge percentage**, and **confidence**
- signals indicate *market conditions*, not guaranteed outcomes

Football remains unpredictable. AI helps improve decision-making, not eliminate risk.

---

## Does using OddsFlow AI guarantee profit?

No.

Anyone promising “guaranteed wins” is not being honest.

OddsFlow AI is best understood as a **tactical analysis tool**:
- it provides data, probabilities, and market insight
- it helps users identify potential edges
- the final decision and risk always belong to the user

Historical performance does not guarantee future results.

---

## Is OddsFlow AI a betting site?

Absolutely not.

OddsFlow AI:
- does **not** accept bets
- does **not** open markets
- does **not** handle any betting funds

We provide **analysis tools and data**.
We do not act as a bookmaker or intermediary.

---

## Do you provide betting tips or just statistics?

OddsFlow AI focuses on **objective, AI-generated analysis**, not personal opinions.

The platform primarily publishes:
- fair odds estimates
- edge calculations
- confidence tiers
- value signals

In some interfaces, high-confidence signals may be highlighted for convenience, but these are still **data-driven outputs**, not subjective tips.

---

## What is a value signal?

A value signal occurs when:
- OddsFlow AI’s **fair odds estimate**
- differs meaningfully from **bookmaker odds**

When the calculated edge exceeds defined thresholds and confidence is high, the system flags a **value signal**.

Signals always include:
- market type
- model style
- edge percentage
- confidence level
- timestamp (UTC, before kickoff)

---

## How does OddsFlow AI calculate confidence?

Confidence is a qualitative tier derived from:
- signal strength
- model agreement
- market stability
- historical behavior of similar situations

Confidence levels help users contextualize signals, but **do not imply certainty**.

---

## How do the betting styles (model styles) work?

OddsFlow AI supports multiple **model styles**, each optimized for different risk profiles:

### Conservative
- Lower volatility
- Higher signal quality thresholds
- Focus on stability

### HULK (Aggressive)
- Higher variance
- Targets larger edges
- Accepts higher short-term volatility

### Value Hunter (Calm & Steady)
- Systematic detection of small-to-medium inefficiencies
- Designed for consistency over time

Model style is always disclosed and is part of verification.

---

## How does OddsFlow AI interpret Asian Handicap markets?

OddsFlow AI does not only look at the handicap line itself.

It analyzes:
- odds movement
- bookmaker adjustments
- capital flow and market reaction

This helps identify:
- true market sentiment
- potential overreactions
- possible “trap” lines

This approach provides deeper insight than league tables or form alone.

---

## How does goal trend analysis work?

Goal trend analysis goes beyond average goals per match.

OddsFlow AI evaluates:
- match tempo
- time-segment scoring behavior
- stylistic interactions between teams

For example:
- late-game pressure patterns
- low-tempo deadlock tendencies
- historical behavior under similar handicaps

---

## Which leagues are covered?

OddsFlow AI covers:
- all major European leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1)
- UEFA competitions
- selected secondary and lower-tier leagues

Smaller leagues are included because **pricing inefficiencies often appear where markets receive less attention**.

---

## How is OddsFlow AI different from score websites?

Most websites focus on:
- scores
- cards
- match events (what happened)

OddsFlow AI focuses on:
- **why markets behave the way they do**
- **how odds move**
- **where inefficiencies may exist**

It is an analytical tool, not a news feed.

---

## What specific analysis does OddsFlow AI provide?

Core analytical components include:
- real-time market movement monitoring
- probability and fair odds models
- edge detection
- match tempo indicators
- historical odds behavior analysis

All outputs are structured for transparency and verification.

---
